#I Love Puerto Rico

The idea for this repository came out of many conversations with people who really love their island and who want to stay there despite some of the issues that make it difficult.  

##Running
* Install Homebrew [Link]
* Install Node and NPM (`brew install node`)
* Install mongo (`brew install mongo`);
* Install nodemon (`npm install -g nodemon`)
* Open a terminal window. Type `mongod`  Minimize the window.
* Open another terminal window. Do the following:
  *  `cd directory/you/cloned/ilovepr/in`
  *  `nodemon app.js`
  * This will watch your filesystem for changes and restart the app as needed.
* Code away!!!


[The Original Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) README is much more useful and detailed, but I figured I'd make a quick and dirty guide on running this specific app.
